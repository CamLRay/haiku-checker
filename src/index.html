          This will track your text, <br />
          But English has many rules, <br />
          So please understand.

        <p>
          Prefix and Suffix, <br />
          We have had a hard time with, <br />
          It's a lot to code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, and one more thing. <br />
          I do not think compound words <br />
          Will work too well here.
        </p>
        <p>
          What is a Diphthong? <br />
          It is defined by mouth sounds. <br />
          Not too consistent.
        </p>
        <p>
          We found through research <br />
          There exists a database. <br />
          But it's in Python.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rules are made to break. <br />
          I think that is what they say. <br />
          But this is too much.
